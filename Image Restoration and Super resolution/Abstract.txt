Image Restoration and Super Resolution is a classical problem in the field of Computer Vision where we perform estimation of High Resolution original image from a Low resolution corrupted image. It is an ill posed problem for which multiple solutions may exist. Corruption in Images can occur due to various reasons like uniform blur, Noise, In-painting, Compression, Motion blur etc. 
In our project we are attempting to obtain super resolution using an encoder - decoder framework based Very Deep Convolutional Network and comparing it with various architectures to find the model which gives best results. We found out that the proposed framework with skip connections  works best for denoising while Generative Adversarial Network based architecture performs well on deblurring task.
