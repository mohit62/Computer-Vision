Running the code for deblurring task:
Download converteddata file from box and place it in the same folder as Deblur.py and run as aprun python Deblur.py

Download noisydataset file from box and place it in the same folder as other python files and run as aprun python filename.py

where filename is:
resblocknew: for convolution deconvolution with skip connections

withouDeconv:for full convolution network with skip connections with 
MaxPooling and Upsampling instead of deconvolution layers

withoutskip:for convolution deconvolution without skip connections

Test:for predicting the output of a blur/noisy image

evaluation: evaluates model for given set of test data returning psnr value
